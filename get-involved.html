<p>"I rushed a fraternity my freshman year, not really knowing what I was getting in to. I'm so glad I took that leap of faith though, since my brothers today are my closest friends on campus. I don't know where I would be without their support and friendship!"</p>

<h4>Lily Wexman</h4>
<p>"Sometimes you just have to do things because they're fun! I joined the knitting club my sophomore year as a way to take a break and relax a bit on my Sunday afternoons. I can truley say it's the best coping method I have for dealing with stress! The people in the club are wonderful, it's so nice to be around people with common interests, even if it is something as simple as knitting!"</p>
