<p>Welcome incoming Wash U students! Whether you're an incoming freshman, transfer student, or international student, the first few months at Washington University are bound to challenge you in one way or another, be it academically, socially, or just being able to get a good night's sleep!

If a fun, easy transition into college life is what you're looking for, you've come to the right place.</p>

<p>Freshmen, transfer students, and international students, despite all being "new to wash u," all have very different experiences getting acclimated to the Washington University social and academic scene. That's why there are three different categories on this site, tailor-made for each student's experience. While freshmen might have basic questions about the college lifestlye, transfer students might already be equipt to handle themselves in a new college setting, and might have questions in regards to how Wash U is different than their previous institution. And most would probably agree that traveling to a whole new country for school is much different than going out-of-state. With that in mind, each page has been created with each student's unique situation in mind.</p>
