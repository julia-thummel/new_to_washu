<p>looking for some interesting classes to take next semester? try one of these!</p>
<h4>The Psychology of Happiness</h4>
<p>Doesn't this just sound like a fun class?? Learn all about what happesn to your brain when you're happy, and what it actually means to be and feel happy. Also learn a bit about how you can help yourself be a happier person!</p>
<h4>Earth's Future: The Causes and Consequences of Global Climate Change</h4>
<p>This class is incredibly relevant in this day and age, and the professor really knows what they're talking about. It's a really good experience and you can finally feel like you know what you're talking about when someone tells you global warming isn't real and you feel the need to correct them.</p>
<h4>Introduction to Film Studies</h4>
<p>This class might sound easy, but it's actually more than just watching movies all day and calling it homework. Granted that is a big part of it, but there's a ton about movies that one would never even think about until taking this class.</p>
<h4>Literary Modernities: Paris and New York</h4>
<p>This class isn't offered very often, so keep an eye out for it! It's best suited for the literary-inclined student, but it's open to all majors. It's all about comparing the two different cultures of Paris and New York and the ways they're depicted in literature.</p>
