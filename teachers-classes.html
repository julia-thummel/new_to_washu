<h4>Go to Office Hours</h4>
<p>It seems like the most simple, basic piece of advice, and yet students rarely go to their professor's office hours. Of course, not everyone has time to go chat with a professor every week, but if you can go at least once to a professor that you like's office hours, it'll go a long way!</p>
<h4>Ask Questions</h4>
<p>Again, with the obvious advice. But really, asking questions is the easiest way you can participate in class, and it really shows you're interested in what they're saying if you're able to ask relevant questions.</p>
<h4>Answer Questions</h4>
<p>Even if you don't know the answer. Of course, don't say things you know for a fact are wrong, but if a teacher asks a question and no one seems to want to chime in, being that one student to take a risk shows you're on the teacher's side and you want the class to move forward as well.</p>
<h4>Show Interest in Their Work</h4>
<p>Most professors at Wash U are also professionals in their field and are doing their own work at the same time as teaching. Showing interest in what they do not only conveys your interest in their field, but in the long run, building relationships with teachers that have a job you are interested in is in itself networking. Perhaps they would be willing to let you help in their research, or give you a way in to an internship opportunity in the future.</p>

<p>looking for some interesting classes to take next semester? try one of these!</p>
<h4>The Psychology of Happiness</h4>
<p>Doesn't this just sound like a fun class?? Learn all about what happesn to your brain when you're happy, and what it actually means to be and feel happy. Also learn a bit about how you can help yourself be a happier person!</p>
<h4>Earth's Future: The Causes and Consequences of Global Climate Change</h4>
<p>This class is incredibly relevant in this day and age, and the professor really knows what they're talking about. It's a really good experience and you can finally feel like you know what you're talking about when someone tells you global warming isn't real and you feel the need to correct them.</p>
<h4>Introduction to Film Studies</h4>
<p>This class might sound easy, but it's actually more than just watching movies all day and calling it homework. Granted that is a big part of it, but there's a ton about movies that one would never even think about until taking this class.</p>
<h4>Literary Modernities: Paris and New York</h4>
<p>This class isn't offered very often, so keep an eye out for it! It's best suited for the literary-inclined student, but it's open to all majors. It's all about comparing the two different cultures of Paris and New York and the ways they're depicted in literature.</p>
