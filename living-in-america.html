<p>American Culture is a strange thing. At the same time, it's one of the most exciting things you'll experience! American culture, unlike many other cultures of the world, is a relatively new one: after all, America has only been around for the last 200 years, give or take! And yet it's one of the most pervasive cultures in the world, influencing regions all the way on the other side of the globe. One of the best things about American culture is that it's based off the coming together of a bunch of different cultures, so no matter how you fit in, you're contributing to the vibrant mix of cultures that exist in America.</p>

<p>Of course, America is full of its idiosyncracies. Read below to hear about some other international students' encounters with new and strange American customs and traditions.</p>

<h4>The Super Bowl</h4>
<p>"I encountered the super bowl craze my freshman year of being at Wash U, and boy was I unprepared! So here's the knowledge I wish I had known before coming to America about the super bowl. First, there is no correct team to root for. Everyone has different opinions about which team is better and which one should win, but for someone who knows absolutely nothing (and could care less about a bunch of big men ramming their heads together and throwing around a pig skin), it's totally okay to be impartial!"</p>
<h4>Nationalism</h4>
<p>"For some reason, America has a strange infatuation with itself and its need to celebrate freedom. And bald eagles. And saying the word 'Murica. Well that's a bit of an exaggeration. But Americans, unlike the rest of the world, are totally okay with hyper-nationalistic mindsets, so don't be frightened if people start chanting "USA! USA! USA!" at a drunken frat party or something. They're not in a cult. Or so they say."</p>
<h4>Halloween</h4>
<p>"Halloween is a strange holiday, I'm pretty sure it's meant for kids to dress up and go around collecting candy from strangers' doors, but college students take halloween to the next level. It's an excuse for many to dress up in ways they wouldn't dream of dressing normally. Which is kind of fun. So enjoy it! It's super weird, but who doesn't love to play dress up and get free candy??"</p>
<h4>Units of Measurement</h4>
<p>"unfortunately, this is one tradition that won't make your life more fun. Who knows why Americans still refuse to get on board with the rest of the world, but it looks like this is one unfortunate tradition that is here to stay."</p>
