        <p>So your first college experience didn't exactly work out. Choosing the right college for you is a very difficult decision, and like many things in life, we don't always get it right the first time. Luckily there's always time for second chances, especially here at Washington University. Wash U's priority is to make sure you acclimate well into the campus culture, so that your second time around exceeds expectations rather than disappoints!</p>

        <p>Washu's thriving campus community is a great place to call home. But don't take our word- hear it straight from your new peers!</p>

        <h4>Sarah Whittmore</h4>
          <p>"I came to Washington University after spending a year at Ohio State University. For me, the campus culture just wasn't a fit at Ohio State; I wanted greek life for sure, but I didn't want it to take over every single aspect of my life. Here at Wash U I've found my niche among my sorority sisters, and joined a couple campus clubs too!"</p>

        <h4>Alex Cuardos</h4>
          <p>"I certainly wish I had started out here at Wash U! I spent my freshman year at NYU hoping that the big apple wouldn't be too much for me. After spending the whole year struggling to get into classes that weren't big enough to fit everyone who wanted to take them, I decided enough was enough. Wash U does a great job keeping class sizes small, and I found I've had much more opportunity here to make connections with my professors."</p>

        <h4>Rachel Goldberg</h4>
          <p>I transfered to the Sam Fox School of Design and Visual Arts at Washington University after spending a year at Pratt Institute, which is an all-art school. I realized I wanted to be able to get a liberal arts education in addition to an art education, and I find that Wash U offers the perfect balance between the two fields!"</p>

        <h4>Dante Williams</h4>
          <p>After transfering to Wash U, I can't imagine how I spent my freshman year anywhere else. At first I was worried that I wouldn't fit in on such an elite campus, coming from a state school. But I soon found that everyone here is incredibly friendly and welcoming, and I've never felt more at home!</p>
