<p>The international student's first-year experience is one unlike any other: not only are you attending a new school with new, unfamiliar faces, but you're leaving your country and culture to try and figure out a new one! For some international students, that means literally traveling halfway accross the globe. Talk about jet lag! </p>

<p>To get you somewhat familiar with the Washington University campus, here are some photos of the main Danforth campus. Below you'll find a list of various bits of advice from some older international students who at one point went through the same things as you are going through right now!</p>

<p>Are you worried about understanding American culture? Or maybe you're already sick of people mispronouncing your name? Read some older students' advice on how they navigated frustrating situations in their first year here at Washington University.</p>

<h4>Jiahang Kuang</h4>
<p>"I went to international schools growing up in China, so I thought I was pretty well prepared for life in America attending a prestigious American Institution like Wash U. Of course, I was nowhere near as prepared as I should have been. I found that no one could really pronounce my name, and though I knew many Chinese people often take an English name in addition to their Chinese name, I wasn't prepared to make that sacrifice. So instead of letting people continue to mispronounce my name, I asked them to call me KJ. That way I could keep the essence of my real name, but still have it be pronouncable by my peers."</p>

<h4>Sankalp Patel</h4>
<p>Coming from India, where Bollywood is almost as big as Hollywood here in America, I was expecting to see a lot of people who looked like movie stars. Turns out there's only a handful of americans that really play a part in hollywood, and most of them are just regular students like myself."</p>

<h4>Elizabeth Huntington</h4>
<p>I'm studying here at Washington University rather than in my native country of England. I knew Americans adored british people, but I didn't realize how much people would comment on my accent! I know that it's fairly uncommon here in America, but I couln't help shake the feeling that people were just drawn to me because of my accent.</p>

<h4>Paolo Feliz</h4>
<p>Soon after I came to Wash U I realized that my native Brazilian culture was something that people wanted to know more about, not something I ought to downplay. Being an international student means you have a unique global perspective on a lot of things, and many people on campus find that very interesting!"</p>
